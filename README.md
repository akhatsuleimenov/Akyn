# Akyn
Akyn is a Jarvis(Iron Man) like artificial intelligence that helps to make morning and night routines more pleasant. As a student, I can indeed say that many of us are lazy. We keep procrastinating a lot and as a result, get stressed out when the deadline approaches. Akyn is a way to change that. With only 2 buttons, you can escalate your morning and night routines to a new level.

As part of the morning routine, Akyn will turn on the AC for you and greet you in a respectful manner. Afterward, it will read out(over voice) the emails you have gotten over the night. And as a last action, it will play motivational music so there is no way you still lay in your bed.

When you go to sleep, Akyn will turn off the lights and AC for you. Afterward, Akyn voices over your alarm time for tomorrow and starts listing the events from your Google Calendar for tomorrow. This way you will start visualizing tomorrow starting from tonight.
